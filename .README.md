# My git-template
Basic template for hooks to support updating ctags when codebase changes
also adds an exclude for `.tags`, which is the name of the ctags file generated

To make this default template: `git config init.templatedir <absolute-path to this cloned repo>`

At present these hooks were copied from an article titled [Getting started with Ctags with Vim and Git by Aaron Young](https://geekdude.github.io/tech/ctags/), but I plan to update the hooks as needed for my workflow.
